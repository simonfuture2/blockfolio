        Welcome to my blockfolio, my name is Simon Batrony a backend solidity smart contract developer. My hands-on experience was gained through


       community mentorship, blockchain tutorials, Peer development projects, hackathons, and webinars. I am always looking for more opportunities to learn


       more and add new skills to my toolbelt, allowing me to grow into a well-versed blockchain specialist. It is my goal to become a reputable leader in the web3


       space to help guide the individuals who will come after me. I want to be a role model to the community and show others that look like me, a comfortable and safe


       place to learn, grow and earn. My aspirations goes beyond a paycheck and career, however, it is necessary to obtain capital to build out the educational resource for


       new developers and people transitioning from web2 to web3. I find enjoyment in analyzing data and report a strategic solution for testing. I am the best when working


       on a team focused on a goal with real world application use-case. I am at my best leading a group of intelligent minds, and bringing out the highest level of


       performance from each person. Understanding a person's mind is not easy nor is it predictable, however, through experience and intuition, my God-given ability to


       Connecting with any tpe of personality allows me to become a valuable asset for customer and employee engagement and success. Thank you for your time, and please do not


       hesitate to reach out to learn more about me.
