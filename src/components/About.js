            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Welcome to my blockfolio, my name is Simon Batrony the CEO & Founder of PSB Advanced Technology, established in 2010. Our core. My hands-on experience was gained through


       community mentorship, blockchain tutorials, Peer development projects, hackathons, and webinars. I am always looking for more opportunities to learn


       more and add new skills to my toolbelt, allowing me to grow into a well-versed blockchain specialist. It is my goal to become a reputable leader in the web3


       space to help guide the individuals who will come after me. I want to be a role model to the community and show others that look like me, a comfortable and safe


       place to learn, grow and earn. The knowledge, skills, and abilities obtained throughout my life are focused on enhancing my future self. Through construction, 
       property management, electrical, community service, and fatherhood, my life has taught me the lessons that most people are afraid to try. My setbacks were all lessons 
       that taught me a new skill that made me into the asset I am today. My set of unique abilities makes me a formidable opponent to a competitor and a secret weapon to my team. 
       I have the mindset to lead program management and drive progress against a priority strategic plan, by using collaborative communication methods to bring out the best in each team member. 
       I understand the importance of leading a strategic initiative from upper management and communicating well with leadership on various levels. My analytical ability allows for 
       developing reporting insights from market signals, client experiences, interactions, technical advancements, and captured data. I am proficient at explaining difficult topics 
       and high-level knowledge in ways to make it more approachable for all levels. Along with my mental skillsets, I focus on my physical and spiritual stability by continuing to educate 
       myself and networking with other mentors and industry leaders. In the new information age, the question is now, How quickly can you adapt? How well can you handle challenges? I know 
       that I can excel in many areas and organizations, however, I am not a commodity for hire, I understand my value and completely understand how to utilize my skillsets to increase 
       productivity and client engagement to lead to revenue generation. I enjoy Sales and Challenging Projects to test out my abilities. I enjoy working with a team that respects each other's hard work 
       and is willing to provide the capital for high-level performance.
