            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Continuing to challenge myself and work on open-sourced projects to stay current with any updates such as Helium, 
              Handshake, Celo, Algorand, Solana, and in blockchain ecosystems, the responsibility to level up is dependent 
              on your willingness to learn. Technology is a part of who I am, so attending conferences like the 2021 Open Source 
              Hardware Summit, Handycon, and Consensus sponsored by Coindesk, along with attending weekly ETH Dev calls, 
              Crypto Mining PoW (proof of work), and anything blockchain-related, is just Fun for me. This is not my hobby, 
              his is just what I do, so if you're looking for a well-rounded Blockchain, Crypto,  Web3 Development Specialist. 
              In my free time, I teach my kids how to play the piano, and use the raspberry pi4 to teach them Linux. 
              I enjoy listening to Black Violin, Classical HipHop music really activates my creativity and leadership motivation. 
              All of this go doesn’t happen without some downtime, that’s where I will enjoy the gym, dancing, meditation, 
              and improving my chi. Being able to shut down and focus on Qigong Movements is like restarting your PC for 
              new updates to be pushed and installed.
