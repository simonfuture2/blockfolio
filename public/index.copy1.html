Technology is apart of who I am, so attending conferences like 2021 Open Source Hardware Summit (Oshwa) , Handycon , Consensus sponsored by Coindesk, along with attending weekly ETH Dev calls, Crypto Mining PoW (proof of work), and anything blockchain related, is just Fun for me. This is not my hobby, this is just what I do, so if your looking for a well rounded Blockchain/Crypto/Web3 Development Specialist/Manager. On my free time, I teach my kids how to play the piano, and use the raspberry pi4 to teach them Linux. I enjoy listening to Black Violin , Classical HipHop music really activates my creativity and leadership motivation. All of this go doesn’t happen without some down time, that’s where I will enjoy the gym, dancing, meditation and improving my chi. Being able to shut down and focus on Qigong Movements is like restarting your PC for new updates to be pushed and installed.</p>

        <p>Information Technology Specialist with 15+ years of analytical data staffing, recruitment, database and help desk support, along with 3 years experience as a Human Resource Specialist. Dedication to supporting the Soldiers for the Department of Army in a collaborative work environment has amplified and enhanced my knowledge, skills and abilities immensely. The ability to multitask on a daily basis was a requirement to complete increasing responsibilities as well as utilizing analytical thinking on a daily basis for problem solving and troubleshooting client users. Inter-personality ability allows for easy teamwork to achieve any given duty on time. Contract management, researching innovative technologies, designing presentations, and completion of training certifications as preparation to brief upper management increases productivity. I am passionate about learning the latest advancements in technology, I am currently focused on Blockchain Development. In my short time, I have worked on DeFi exchange projects, coding NFT ERC-721, ERC-20 Ethereum Tokens and Smart contracts, along with understanding the best Real World use cases for Blockchain technologies, for example the Helium Blockchain. We are building the IoT LoraWAN network for sensor data. The Helium Blockchain is an advancement and addition to the current network infrastructure. The network is based on reliable coverage which creates the ability for network users to use compatible sensors. For this network to work, deploying hotspots for Proof-of-Coverage uses radio frequency to produce proofs that can be used for analytical strategic solutions. I have over a decade of experience analyzing large datasets to create solutions for potential future vulnerabilities. Along with verifying coverage locations with the Glamos Field Device, which gives me the RSSI and SNR values that has given me crucial information on the benefits for future hotspot and sensor placements.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When I am not thinking about technology, then I am being a father to 2 lovely boys, and husband to my wife of 20yrs. Not only am I a committed individual, being strategic comes from playing turn-based strategy games like Civilization, XCOM, or RPGs like Final Fantasy. Teaching my kids about ownership is important to me, and I live by example from creating my own apparel collection design branded FutureSELF. The very first IoT Blockchain apparel line owned and designed by me.</p>
